# CoinInspector
This program connects to the binance api and recieves aggregated trades from all crypto currencies traded in bitcoin.
If the real number of aggregated trades (buy trades - sell trades) exceeds a certain number, an alarm is sounded which the UI part of the program recieves.
A sound is then emitted and an alarm with the trades plotted in charts is presented.
